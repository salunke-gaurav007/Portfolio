          <p>
              I’m a second-year Computer Science student at RCPIT, Shirpur, with a growing passion for web development. I’ve worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and have started exploring React as well. I’m also comfortable using MS Excel for organizing and managing data. I enjoy taking initiative—I'm an active member of the Akatsuki Coding Club and currently serve as the Management Head of the Reflection Club. Along with tech and management, I genuinely love public speaking and being on stage—it’s something that excites me just as much as coding. I enjoy learning new skills, working with driven teams, and stepping up whenever there's an opportunity to contribute or lead.
